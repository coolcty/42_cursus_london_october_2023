Q: The differences between aptitude and apt, or what SELinux or AppArmor is. In short, understand what you use!

Apt and aptitude are both package management tools in Debian-based Linux distributions, used to handle packages. apt is more commonly used and is often considered more user-friendly, while aptitude provides a text-based interactive interface and more features.


Q:  What SELinux or AppArmor is 
SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) and AppArmor (Application Armor) are Linux security modules that provide a way to support access control security policies. They are used to restrict programs' capabilities with per-program profiles.

Q: A SSH service
SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that provides a secure way to access a remote computer. An SSH service, often running on port 22, allows secure remote login, secure file transfers, and executes remote commands.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo systemctl status ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
In nano
Port 4242 
PermitRootLogin no

"PermitRootLogin prohibit-password"  means that the root user can only authenticate using methods other than password. These methods could be public key authentication or certificate-based authentication.

ip addr show
curl ifconfig.me

Configure your operating system with the UFW firewall and leave only port 4242 open.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow 4242
sudo ufw status verbose

Firewall must be active when you launch your virtual machine.

sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose
systemctl status ufw
sudo systemctl enable ufw
sudo systemctl start ufw
sudo reboot
systemctl status UFW


Change the Hostname Temporarily:
sudo hostname new_hostname
sudo nano /etc/hosts

Change the Hostname Permanently:
sudo nano /etc/hostname
sudo nano /etc/hosts
sudo systemctl restart ssh

relogin
127.0.1.1 4242

Implement a strong password policy.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libpam-pwquality

sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password

modify this line:
password        requisite                       pam_pwquality.so retry=3 minlen=10 difok=3 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1
retry=3 specifies the number of retries if the password fails to meet the policy.
minlen=10 sets the minimum length of the password to 10 characters.
difok=3 requires that the new password differ by at least 3 characters from the old one.
ucredit=-1 requires at least one uppercase letter.
lcredit=-1 requires at least one lowercase letter.
dcredit=-1 requires at least one digit.
ocredit=-1 requires at least one special character.

Open the following to see detailed pam_pwquality.so parameter
sudo nano /etc/security/pwquality.conf

Immediate Termination: requisite modules
Deferred Failure: required modules
Eg:
A required password check module.
A requisite two-factor authentication (2FA) module.
A required logging module that records all authentication attempts.


Password Aging Policy:
sudo nano /etc/login.defs
PASS_MAX_DAYS 90 sets the maximum number of days a password may be used.
PASS_MIN_DAYS 10 sets the minimum number of days allowed between password changes.
PASS_WARN_AGE 7 sets the number of days warning given before a password expires.

getent means get entries
sudo groupadd user42
sudo groupdel user42
getent group
getent group user42


To see group and user list:
getent group 

check the primary group of a user:
id -gn username

Check the users of a given group:
getent group groupName

How to add user:
sudo adduser newusername

Check the groups of a user:
groups username

Add a new group:
sudo groupadd newgroupname

Add a user to a given group:
sudo usermod -a -G groupName username

Enter the root shell:
sudo su -
Exit: logout
su is a command to run sth as a certain user

Change password:
passwd 
passwd username

Aa16291991

root password: Bc75586994
Try new password: Bc75586995
Login to a certain user:
sudo su - username

Configure  strongly a group(only sudo visudo command to edit /etc/sudoers file):
sudo visudo


Edit crontab ( crontab -e) and add a line like:
*/10 * * * * /path/to/monitoring.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
