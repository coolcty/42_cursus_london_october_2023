Q: X.org

Free and open-source implementation of the display server for the X Window System stewarded by the X.Org Foundation. The X Window System is a windowing system for bitmap displays, common on Unix-like operating systems.

Q: The differences between aptitude and apt, or what SELinux or AppArmor is. In short, understand what you use!

Apt and aptitude are both package management tools in Debian-based Linux distributions, used to handle packages. apt is more commonly used and is often considered more user-friendly, while aptitude provides a text-based interactive interface and more features.


Q:  What SELinux or AppArmor is 
SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) and AppArmor (Application Armor) are Linux security modules that provide a way to support access control security policies. They are used to restrict programs' capabilities with per-program profiles.

Q: A SSH service
SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that provides a secure way to access a remote computer. An SSH service, often running on port 22, allows secure remote login, secure file transfers, and executes remote commands.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo systemctl status ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
In nano
Port 4242 
PermitRootLogin no

"PermitRootLogin prohibit-password"  means that the root user can only authenticate using methods other than password. These methods could be public key authentication or certificate-based authentication.

ip addr show
curl ifconfig.me

Configure your operating system with the UFW firewall and leave only port 4242 open.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow 4242
sudo ufw status verbose

Firewall must be active when you launch your virtual machine.

sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose
systemctl status ufw
sudo systemctl enable ufw
sudo systemctl start ufw
sudo reboot
systemctl status UFW


Change the Hostname Temporarily:
sudo hostname new_hostname
sudo nano /etc/hosts

Change the Hostname Permanently:
sudo nano /etc/hostname
sudo nano /etc/hosts
sudo systemctl restart ssh

relogin
127.0.1.1 4242

Implement a strong password policy.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libpam-pwquality

sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password

modify this line:
password        requisite                       pam_pwquality.so retry=3 minlen=10 difok=3 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-1
retry=3 specifies the number of retries if the password fails to meet the policy.
minlen=10 sets the minimum length of the password to 10 characters.
difok=3 requires that the new password differ by at least 3 characters from the old one.
ucredit=-1 requires at least one uppercase letter.
lcredit=-1 requires at least one lowercase letter.
dcredit=-1 requires at least one digit.
ocredit=-1 requires at least one special character.

Open the following to see detailed pam_pwquality.so parameter
sudo nano /etc/security/pwquality.conf

Immediate Termination: requisite modules
Deferred Failure: required modules
Eg:
A required password check module.
A requisite two-factor authentication (2FA) module.
A required logging module that records all authentication attempts.


Password Aging Policy:
sudo nano /etc/login.defs
PASS_MAX_DAYS 90 sets the maximum number of days a password may be used.
PASS_MIN_DAYS 10 sets the minimum number of days allowed between password changes.
PASS_WARN_AGE 7 sets the number of days warning given before a password expires.

getent means get entries
sudo groupadd user42
sudo groupdel user42
getent group
getent group user42


To see group and user list:
getent group 

check the primary group of a user:
id -gn username

Check the users of a given group:
getent group groupName

How to add user:
sudo adduser newusername

Check the groups of a user:
groups username

Add a new group:
sudo groupadd newgroupname

Add a user to a given group:
sudo usermod -a -G groupName username

Enter the root shell:
sudo su -
Exit: logout
su is a command to run sth as a certain user

Change password:
passwd 
passwd username

Aa16291991

root password: Bc75586994
Try new password: Bc75586995
Login to a certain user:
sudo su - username

Configure  strongly a group(only sudo visudo command to edit /etc/sudoers file):
sudo visudo


Edit crontab ( sudo crontab -u root -e) and add a line like:
*/10 * * * * sh /path/to/monitoring.sh

Get the signature:
cd /mnt/c/Users/coolc/VirtualBox VMs/Born2beRoot
sha1sum Born2beRoot.vdi>signature.txt
or
Windows: certUtil -hashfile rocky_serv.vdi sha1


Defense:
1. Basic Functioning of a Virtual Machine (VM)
Hypervisor; Virtual Hardware; Isolation;Resource Allocation; Operating Systems and Applications
2. Choice of Operating System in VMs
specific needs of the applications to be run; compatibility with existing infrastructure; security requirements; and administrative familiarity. 

3. Basic Differences Between Rocky Linux and Debian
Rocky Linux:

Purpose: Rocky Linux is designed to be a downstream, binary-compatible release with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), intended to replace CentOS after its shift in project focus.
Package Management: Uses yum and dnf for package management, typical for RHEL-based distributions.
System Management: Emphasizes stability and long-term support, appealing to enterprise environments.
Debian:

Purpose: Debian is a community-driven project known for its dedication to free software principles, stability, and security.
Package Management: Uses the apt
System Management: Focuses on versatility and supports a wider range of hardware architectures.
The choice :compatibility with existing systems, preference for community vs. enterprise support, and specific system requirements.

4. Benefits of Virtual Machines
Isolation;
Resource Efficiency: Multiple VMs can run on a single physical machine, allowing for better utilization of physical resources.
Flexibility and Testing: VMs can be used to create safe testing environments, easily replicate different computing environments, and rollback to previous states.
Disaster Recovery: VMs are easy to backup, migrate, and restore, which enhances business continuity and disaster recovery strategies.
Simplification of Administration: Virtualization can simplify IT operations and reduce hardware costs by consolidating servers and reducing physical infrastructure.
The use of VMs can significantly enhance the agility and efficiency of IT operations in businesses, providing scalable solutions that adjust to varying workload demands.

Difference between aptitude and apt:
aptitude and apt are both package management tools used on Debian and other Debian-based Linux distributions (like Ubuntu). The former is more powerful for package dependencies, the latter is easier to use.


AppArmor (Application Armor) is a Linux kernel security module that helps in restricting programs' capabilities with per-program profiles.

LVM stands for Logical Volume Manager, a system for managing disk storage in a more flexible and sophisticated manner
Physical Volumes (PVs)
Volume Group (VG)
Logical Volumes (LVs)
Filesystems
resize volumes dynamically
Snapshots: LVM can create snapshots of Logical Volumes.
Storage Pooling: LVM allows for the pooling of physical storage from multiple disks into a single unified Volume Group. 
Create mirrored volumes across different disks.
Abstracts the physical properties of the disk for ease of management.
